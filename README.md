# Number Guessing Game

deployment Verce link: number-guessing-game-five-pi.vercel.app


A simple web-based number guessing game created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player guesses a number between 1 and 100, and the game provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct) after each guess. The game tracks the number of attempts and shows the player's previous guesses. The game ends when the correct number is guessed or after 10 attempts.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the player enters a number between 1 and 100.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempts Tracking**: Tracks and displays the number of attempts made.
- **Restart Option**: After the game ends, a "Play Again" button appears to restart the game.
- **Simple and Clean Design**: Responsive design with basic styling using CSS.
